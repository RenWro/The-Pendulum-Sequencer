# The-Pendulum-Sequencer

The Pendulum Sequencer is an interactive audiovisual application where the physics of pendulums are used to create a MIDI sequencer. It consists of a series of pendulums initially arranged to produce a pendulum wave effect. Each pendulum swings back and forth accordingly to the amount of gravity and resistance chosen by the participant. Triggers can be placed in the canvas, and every time a pendulum hits a trigger a MIDI note related to that pendulum is sent to an external synthesizer. The intensity, or velocity, of each note is a product of the momentum when the pendulum hits a trigger and the mass of its sphere. The participant can choose between different scales; change the amount of gravity and resistance; change the length of each pendulum and the radius of its "sphere"; drag and drop pendulums as desired.
